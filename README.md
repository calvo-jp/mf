# Module Federation

A JavaScript feature that allows multiple independently-developed bundles to interact as if they were one application, it leads to more modular development of large applications, allowing for separate development and deployment of each bundle while still being able to communicate with each other.

## Pros

- Modularity
  By breaking an application into multiple bundles, each bundle can be developed and deployed separately, which can make development and maintenance more manageable.
- Decoupling
  Modules can interact with each other without having to be tightly coupled, which can make it easier to update or replace individual modules without affecting the rest of the application.
- Reusability
  Modules can be shared and reused across multiple applications, reducing code duplication and improving development efficiency.
